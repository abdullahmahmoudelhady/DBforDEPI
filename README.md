# DBforDEPI

## Project Description

This project aims to build an extensive company database comprising several interconnected tables. Our focus is on designing, creating, and populating these tables, followed by establishing relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity. The project emphasizes collaborative efforts in managing various aspects of the database and validating the consistency and accuracy of the data.

Group 1: Employees and Departments
Group 1 is responsible for managing the Employees and Departments tables. This includes designing the schema, populating the tables with initial data, and establishing the necessary constraints and relationships to maintain data integrity.

Tasks
Employees Table:

Columns: EmployeeID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, HireDate, Position, Salary
Task: Create and populate with initial data
Departments Table:

Columns: DepartmentID (Primary Key), DepartmentName, Location
Task: Create and populate with initial data

## Additional Requirements

Constraints and Relationships:

Use ALTER TABLE to add foreign key constraints.
Use UPDATE to ensure data consistency where necessary.
Integrity:

Ensure that all primary keys are unique.
Use appropriate data types for each column.
Implement NOT NULL constraints where applicable.
Use CHECK constraints to enforce data integrity.
Validation:

Insert sample data before running constraint scripts.
Ensure data consistency before establishing relationships.

Documentation:

Document tables, including column definitions, constraints, and relationships.
Provide SQL scripts for creating and populating tables, and separate scripts for adding constraints and relationships.
